# algolib
## A C library holding pre-baked general-solution algorithms and data structures

Algolib is a solution to the predicament of wanting a library that has basic data structures and good algorithms but you are using C and don't want to use messy and syntactically disturbing datatypes. This library seeks to make the main data structures used for holding data and their respective algorithms.
